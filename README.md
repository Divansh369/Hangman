# Hangman Game:

The Hangman game is a word guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. If the guessing player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, it is revealed. If the letter does not occur in the word, a part of a gallows and a victim is drawn. The game ends when the guessing player successfully guesses the word or when all the parts of the victim are drawn.

# Game Modes:

The code supports two game modes: \
1). Single-player mode, the computer randomly selects a word from predefined categories such as months, weekdays, or zodiac signs. \
2). In two-player mode, one player inputs a word for the other player to guess.

# Gameplay:
